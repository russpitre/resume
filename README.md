# Russell Pitre - Resume

Hello, this repository is my resume. The resume is a bare-bones ReactJS project
that renders a PDF by utilizing the [React-pdf](https://react-pdf.org) package.
You will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) before you can clone and
run the project.

## To view the resume...

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/russpitre/resume.git
> cd resume
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

Once the app has fully started visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
